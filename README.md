## Project 1 Requirements

### For a C, you will need to:

- [x] Collect the data from your selected source. Some pre-processing might be needed.
- [x] Set up an Github account to share source code and project report to instructor and TA
- [x] Allow users to select a profile and display its temporal data in the graph. For example, by using a dropdown menu.
- [x] Allow user to add more than one profiles (to compare) or all profiles into the graph.
- [x] Graph labels are available and easy to read.

### For a B, you will need to add:

- [ ] Display and compare to the average temporal data on request. (example?)
- [x] Allow secondary profile selection from a US map or a network or a cloud.
- [x] Highlight the profile on the secondary profile selection when mousing over a time series.
- [ ] Your visualization should be responsive.
- [ ] Allow users to quickly zoom into a time interval. (can I hide the months and rely only on the hover popup for large series?)

### For an A, you will need to add:

- [ ] Compare the selected temporal variable to other variables (that you think it is useful). (Such as allowing for multiple charts?)
- [ ] Find some interesting events in the data and highlight them on your webpage through screen snapshots. (example?)
- [ ] Plot a time series with requested features on the graph, such as a sudden drop or pump. (example?)
